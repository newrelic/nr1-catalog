# Capturing Screenshots for the New Relic One Catalog

This is one effective method for capturing screenshots that adhere to the catalog requirements:

1. Use the responsive device layout in `Chrome` devtools
2. Set Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) to 1.0 (Note: you might need to click `Add device pixel ratio` first from the menu in the top-right to be able to set it)
3. Set resolution to be 3:2 and between 1600px and 2400px wide (Note `1602x1068` is recommended to keep the image dense with content)
4. Click `Capture screenshot` from the menu
5. Save that file to your `catalog/screenshots` directory under the naming convention `screenshot[xx].png`
