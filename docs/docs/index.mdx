# Welcome to the New Relic One Catalog Application Submission Process

With the release of the `New Relic One Catalog`, customers now have the ability to install third-party open source and partner applications into their `New Relic One` account via a few clicks.

This repository is the entry point for `Developers` to add their applications to that catalog.

## What is the nr1-catalog repository?

`nr1-catalog` is a repository of `submodules` that each links to a Nerdpack designed to fit into the `New Relic One Catalog`. This repository contains three main components:

1. A collection of `submodules` each pointing to a New Relic One application in a separate `git` repository.
2. [Automation](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-catalog/tree/master/.github) to handle the verification of PR's and promotion of `submodules` to the `New Relic One Catalog` on a merge to the `nr1-catalog master` branch.
3. Instructions for submitting projects to the `New Relic One Catalog` as well as documentation on the standard(s) for catalog projects (i.e. this site).

## Process for Submitting Code to the New Relic One Catalog

The following highlights a high-level process in `5 Steps` for submitting code to the `nr1-catalog` and have that application available for global installation in the `New Relic One Catalog`.
